# End-to-End-Recipe-Recommendation-System-using-Flask-and-Machine-Learning
This project is an end-to-end Recipe Recommendation Web App that suggests similar recipes based on ingredients and nutritional values (calories, fat, carbs, protein, etc.).
It integrates TF-IDF vectorization for text data and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for similarity-based recipe retrieval, deployed using Flask for real-time interaction.

#Tech Stack: Python, Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn, HTML, CSS, TF-IDF, KNN
